#Business Problem

In recent years, both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced high cancellation rates, resulting in reduced revenue and underutilized room capacity. The primary objective of this project is to analyze hotel booking cancellations and the factors associated with them. By doing so, we aim to provide insights and recommendations to reduce cancellation rates and improve revenue generation.

#Assumptions

•	Unusual events occurring between 2015 and 2017 do not significantly affect the data.
•	The dataset is current and relevant, ensuring efficient analysis.
•	Anticipated negative consequences of implementing suggested techniques are minimal.
•	The hotels are not currently utilizing the proposed solutions.
•	Booking cancellations have a substantial impact on revenue generation.

#Research Questions

What are the key factors that influence hotel reservation cancellations?
What strategies can be implemented to minimize hotel reservation cancellations?
How can hotels utilize data insights to make informed pricing and promotional decisions?

#Hypothesis

•  Higher prices are positively correlated with increased cancellation rates.
•  Longer waiting lists are associated with higher frequencies of cancellations.
•  Offline travel agents contribute more to reservations compared to online channels.
