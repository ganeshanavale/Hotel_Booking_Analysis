# Hotel_Booking_Analysis.

The project involves analyzing real-world data records of hotel bookings from both a city and a resort hotel, covering the period from 2015 to 2017. The dataset includes details such as bookings, cancellations, and guest information. Our goal is to analyze this Hotel Booking Data to uncover valuable insights and provide recommendations to help increase the revenue of the hotels.
